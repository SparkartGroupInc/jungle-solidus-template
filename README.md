solidus-site-template
=====================

Grunt-init template for a Solidus site. This [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) template helps you get started building Solidus sites by quickly assembling a default file structure for you.

## Using The Template

In order to use this template, you'll need the following:

- [Grunt.js](http://gruntjs.com) installed globally*
- [grunt-init](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-init) installed globally*
- Download/clone this repo
- (Optional) move/rename the template folder to `~/.grunt-init/solidus/`

Once this is done, you can init a new site by running one of the following commands:

```
grunt-init solidus
```

OR (if you haven't moved the template folder to `~/.grunt-init/solidus/`)...

```
grunt-init /path/to/solidus/template/folder/
```
